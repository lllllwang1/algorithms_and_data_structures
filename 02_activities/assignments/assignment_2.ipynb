    "Working on this assignment has been a highly educational experience, involving a deep dive into binary tree traversal algorithms and their complexities. Initially, the task of finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree seemed straightforward, but the nuances of implementing a robust and efficient solution required careful consideration.\n",
    "The collaborative process with my partner was instrumental in refining the solution. We started by understanding the problem thoroughly, paraphrasing it to ensure clarity. Creating a new example was crucial as it tested our comprehension and highlighted potential edge cases. Tracing through the example provided by my partner helped identify areas of improvement and reinforced the correctness of the approach.\n",
    "Implementing the solution involved iterative testing and debugging. The DFS approach was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in traversing all paths from the root to the leaves. Ensuring that the path construction and backtracking were correctly implemented was critical for maintaining the integrity of the paths.\n",
    "Reviewing the solution's time and space complexity helped in understanding its efficiency and potential bottlenecks. The worst-case scenarios, particularly in unbalanced trees, highlighted areas where optimization could be beneficial.\n",
    "Presenting and reviewing the solution with my partner provided valuable feedback and different perspectives. It was a collaborative effort that enhanced the overall quality of the solution. This assignment underscored the importance of thorough testing, clear communication, and collaborative problem-solving in developing efficient algorithms."
